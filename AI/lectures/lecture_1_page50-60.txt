# Boolean Retrieval Model

*   Queries: Users express queries as a Boolean expression
    *   AND, OR, NOT
    *   Can be arbitrarily nested
    *   Ex. query: information AND retrieval AND NOT technology
*   Documents: Views each document as a “bag” of words
*   Return only documents that satisfy the Boolean query.

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image displays a textbook page about the Boolean Retrieval Model. It describes how users express queries and how documents are viewed in this model.

# Exercise

*   Build a Term-Document Incidence Matrix
    *   Which term appears in which document
    *   Rows are terms
    *   Columns are documents
*   Given example collection:
    *   d1: He likes to play, he likes to eat
    *   d2: He likes to eat, and eat, and eat
    *   d3: The thing he likes to eat is apple
    *   d4: The apple he likes to eat is red
    *   d5: He likes to play, and eat red apple

|      | d1 | d2 | d3 | d4 | d5 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| he      | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       |
| likes   | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       |
| to      | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       |
| play    | 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       |
| eat     | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       |
| and     | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       | 1       |
| the     | 0       | 0       | 1       | 1       | 0       |
| thing   | 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       |
| is      | 0       | 0       | 1       | 1       | 0       |
| apple   | 0       | 0       | 1       | 1       | 1       |
| red     | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       | 1       |

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image contains a term-document incidence matrix. The matrix shows the frequency of terms (he, likes, to, play, eat, and, the, thing, is, apple, red) in different documents (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5). The page provides an exercise to build such matrix from a given example collection of documents.

1 if document contains term, 0 otherwise

## Image Descriptions

### Image 1: Term-Document Incidence Matrix
The image shows a term-document incidence matrix, a table that represents the presence or absence of terms within a set of documents. The rows represent the terms ("he", "likes", "to", etc.), and the columns represent the documents (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5). A '1' in a cell indicates that the corresponding term is present in the corresponding document, while a '0' indicates that it is absent. The matrix is labeled with "TERMS" on the left and "Documents" above.

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image displays a term-document incidence matrix. The rows represent terms like "he", "likes", "to", "play", "eat", etc. The columns represent documents labeled "d1" through "d5". The cells contain either a 1 or a 0, indicating the presence or absence of a term in a specific document.  There are also two curved arrows pointing from the column "d1" towards the bottom right corner of the table. Below the table, a query and its application on the rows is given.

# Boolean Retrieval Model

*   Any given query divides the collection into two sets:
    *   retrieved (matching)
    *   not-retrieved (not matching)
*   Returns a set of documents that "exactly" satisfy the query (Boolean expression)
    *   Called "Exact-Match" retrieval
*   Used?
    *   Many search systems still in-use are Boolean
    *   e.g., Email, library catalog, Mac OS X Spotlight, legal search

## Bigger Collections

Consider N = 1 million documents, each with about 1000 words.

Say there are M = 500K distinct terms among these.

500K x 1M matrix has half-a-trillion O's and 1's.

But it has no more than one billion 1's.

matrix is extremely sparse.

What's a better representation?

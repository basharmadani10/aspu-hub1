# Relevance

does item d match query q? ... or ...

is item d relevant to query q?

Relevance is a tricky notion

will the user like it / click on it?

will it help the user achieve a task? (satisfy information need)

is it novel (not redundant)?

Relevance and similarity

i.e. d,q share similar “meaning”

about the same topic / subject / issue

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image is a textbook page titled "Relevance". It lists different interpretations and factors influencing relevance, such as matching a query, user preference, novelty, and similarity. It's presented in a simple, bullet-point style.

# Information Need/Query/Relevance

*   Information need
    *   Topic about which the user desires to know more
    *   In the user's mind!

*   Query
    *   What the user conveys to the computer
    *   Considered one representation of the information need

*   Relevance
    *   Document having a value with respect to the information need
    *   i.e., a document is relevant if it satisfies the information need

## Image Descriptions
Image 1: The image is a textbook page discussing "Information Need/Query/Relevance". It contains bullet points explaining the concepts of information need, query and relevance, including details such as the user's desires and the relationship between documents and information needs.

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: A diagram depicting the challenge of matching search queries to documents. On the left, a cartoon stick figure labeled "Searcher" has a question mark in a thought bubble, representing their concepts. An arrow points down to "Query Terms". On the right, a portrait of William Shakespeare labeled "Autho", represents document concepts. An arrow points down to "Document Terms." A horizontal arrow connects the two sides, with the text "Matching document terms to query terms" above it. Below the arrows is the question "Do these represent the same concepts?".

What is the challenge in relevance?

*   No clear semantics!
    *   “William Shakespeare”
    *   Author history's? list of plays? a play by him?
*   Inherent ambiguity of language!
    *   polysemy: “Apple”, “Jaguar”
*   Relevance is highly subjective!

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image is a table comparing Information Retrieval (IR) and Databases (DB) along different dimensions such as the nature of data retrieved, types of queries, nature of results, and interaction patterns with the system. The comparison highlights the structured nature of DB and the unstructured nature of IR, as well as the exactness of results in DB versus the need for effectiveness measurement in IR.

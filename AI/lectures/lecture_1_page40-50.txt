## Bag-of-Words trick

Can you guess what this is about:
*   per is salary hour £5,594 Neymar's
    *   Neymar's salary per hour is £5,594

*   obesity French is of full cause and fat fries
    *   French fries is full of fat and cause obesity

*   Main idea: Re-ordering doesn't destroy the topic
    *   individual words are “building blocks"
    *   "bag" of words: a “composition” of “meanings"

Image 1: The image is of a textbook page describing the "Bag-of-Words trick". It shows examples of how reordering words does not destroy the topic of a sentence.

Simplest: Bag-of-Words trick

Most search engines use BOW

treat documents and queries as bags of words

A "bag" is a set with repetitions

match = “degree of overlap” between d, q

Retrieval models

statistical models (functions): usually use words as features

decide which documents most likely to be relevant

BOW makes these models tractable (and also effective!)

# Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image is of a textbook page outlining the Bag-of-Words (BOW) technique used in search engines and retrieval models. It lists key aspects of the technique, such as treating documents as bags of words and defining a "bag" as a set with repetitions.

# Boolean Retrieval Model

*   Queries: Users express queries as a Boolean expression
    *   AND, OR, NOT
    *   Can be arbitrarily nested
    *   Ex. query: information AND retrieval AND NOT technology
*   Documents: Views each document as a “bag” of words
*   Return only documents that satisfy the Boolean query.

# Exercise

*   Build a Term-Document Incidence Matrix
    *   Which term appears in which document
    *   Rows are terms
    *   Columns are documents
*   Given example collection:
    *   d1: He likes to play, he likes to eat
    *   d2: He likes to eat, and eat, and eat
    *   d3: The thing he likes to eat is apple
    *   d4: The apple he likes to eat is red
    *   d5: He likes to play, and eat red apple

|      | d1 | d2 | d3 | d4 | d5 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image contains a term-document incidence matrix. The matrix shows the frequency of terms (he, likes, to, play, eat, and, the, thing, is, apple, red) in different documents (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5). The page provides an exercise to build such matrix from a given example collection of documents.

## Image Descriptions

### Image 1: Term-Document Incidence Matrix
The image shows a term-document incidence matrix, a table that represents the presence or absence of terms within a set of documents. The rows represent the terms ("he", "likes", "to", etc.), and the columns represent the documents (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5). A '1' in a cell indicates that the corresponding term is present in the corresponding document, while a '0' indicates that it is absent. The matrix is labeled with "TERMS" on the left and "Documents" above.

## Image Descriptions

Image 1: The image displays a term-document incidence matrix. The rows represent terms like "he", "likes", "to", "play", "eat", etc. The columns represent documents labeled "d1" through "d5". The cells contain either a 1 or a 0, indicating the presence or absence of a term in a specific document.  There are also two curved arrows pointing from the column "d1" towards the bottom right corner of the table. Below the table, a query and its application on the rows is given.

# Boolean Retrieval Model

*   Any given query divides the collection into two sets:
    *   retrieved (matching)
    *   not-retrieved (not matching)
*   Returns a set of documents that "exactly" satisfy the query (Boolean expression)
    *   Called "Exact-Match" retrieval
*   Used?
    *   Many search systems still in-use are Boolean
    *   e.g., Email, library catalog, Mac OS X Spotlight, legal search
